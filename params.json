Dukascopy has made available an excellent [web tool](https://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/marketwatch/historical/) to download tick data for a large a variety of \r\nForex, CFD and commodities. This is awesome and extremely useful for people, like me, trying to study the Forex market. \r\nHowever, it takes a lot of time to download a large data set from the website because you can download only one day per time. In order to solve this issue, I created **duka**.  \r\n\r\n**duka** is a small terminal application that can be used to download ticks for a given date range from the Dukascopy historical data feed for one or more symbols. **duka** takes advantage of python threads and coroutine in order to speed up the download. It takes roughly 10m to download tick data for  one year for a given instrument. No bad :)\r\n\r\nKey features :\r\n - Ticks data with volumes\r\n - Candle formatting with different time-frames ( from 1 minute to 1 day )\r\n - CSV output\r\n - multi-thread support\r\n - Large variety of symbols\r\n\r\nThis is what **duka** looks like:\r\n\r\n![duka](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giuse88/duka/master/.img/Screen%20Shot%202016-04-10%20at%2020.15.51.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, **duka** estimates the time left until the download is completed. This is extremely useful when downloading a large data set. \r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it!! \r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n**duka** requires python 3.5 and request 2.0.1. It can be installed using `pip` as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install duka\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n```\r\n usage: duka [options]\r\n\r\n positional arguments:\r\n    SYMBOLS               symbol list using format EURUSD EURGBP \r\n\r\n optional arguments:\r\n     -h           show help message and exit \r\n     -d DAY       specific day format YYYY-MM-DD (default today)\r\n     -s STARTDATE start date format YYYY-MM-DD (default today)\r\n     -e ENDDATE   end date format YYYY-MM-DD (default today)\r\n     -c CANDLE    use candles instead of ticks. Accepted values 1M 5M 10M 15M 30M 1H 4H 1D\r\n     -f FOLDER    the dowloaded data will be saved in FOLDER (default '.')\r\n     -t THREAD    number of threads (default 10)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n\r\n- Help\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   duka -h\r\n   ```\r\n- Download last available tick set (i.e. yesterday if not Saturday ) for `EURUSD` and `GBPUSD` \r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  duka EURUSD GBPUSD \r\n  ```\r\n- Download ticks for the `EURUSD` for a specific day\r\n\r\n  ``` \r\n  duka EURUSD -d 2016-02-02\r\n  ```\r\n- Download ticks for the `EURUSD` between two dates. For example:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  duka EURUSD -s 2015-01-01 -e 2016-12-31 \r\n  ```\r\n  download all ticks for the 2015 year\r\n\r\n- We can specify only the start date. The default end date will be today. For example:   \r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  duka EURUSD -s 2016-01-01\r\n  ```\r\n  downloads all ticks from the beginning of the year until now. \r\n\r\nAll data is saved in the current folder. You can also specify the number of threads to be used by setting the `t` option. \r\nI recommend not to use too many threads because you might encounter problems opening too many connection to the server. \r\n\r\n## Helping \r\nFound a bug?
